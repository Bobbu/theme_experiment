# theme_experiment

A straightforward project starter that introduces Google fonts and Light/Dark themes into the mix. It currently eschews Material 3, but otherwise is a very nice starting point for any Flutter app where one would like to have a base theme for both light and dark modes.

It borrows from two different tutorial videos one can find on YouTube by Mitch Koko, addressing both Google Fonts and Dark and Light themes as one.

It also leaves in the default "counter" project elements just for good measure.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point if you are interested in having Google Fonts and Dark/Light themes in your own app. The only interesting dependency is the google_fonts package from https://pub.dev.
